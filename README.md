- 👋 Hi, I’m Victor!
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring a handful of technologies but for now focusing on those having to do with builging web applications with .NET. 
- 🌱 I’m most comfortable in C# but I also know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- 🎮 I have done game development as a hobby for many years and I hope to explore the educational potential of game development tools in the future. These days I'm more interested in application development.
- 👨🏽‍💻 Currenlty working on a web application portfolio focused on ASP.NET Core MVC.
