- 👋 Hi, I’m Victor!
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring a handful of technologies at the moment but focusing on object-oriented progaramming in C#. 
- 🌱 I’m learning JavaScript at the moment for school and I've also worked with Python!
- 🎮 I have done game development as a hobby for many years and I hope to explore the educational potential of game development tools in the future. These days I'm more interested in application development, and tools programming. 
- 👨🏽‍💻 I'm most comfortable in C# but most of my freelance experience is in web development.
