- 👋 Hi, I’m Victor!
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring a handful of technologies at the moment before taking a deep dive into what I want to do proffesionaly. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GIT! And as of the time of this update I am two weeks away from starting two summer python classes. Really looking forward to it!
- 🎮 I have done game development as a hobby for many years but I don't see myself as a game dev in the future. These days I'm more interested in data analysis, and tools programming. 
- 👨🏽‍💻 I'm most comfortable in C# but most of my freelance experience is in web development.
