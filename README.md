> I have been helping people create a digital presence online since 2016. Recently I have returned to school to supplement my skills in design with an education in web application programming and database design. I have done game development as a hobby for many years and I hope to explore the educational potential of game development tools in the future. I'm interested in all things data which is why I love web applications!
