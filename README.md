  <h1>👋 Hi, I'm Victor!</h1>
  <p>Web application developer specializing in C#/.NET</p>
</div>

### 👨🏽‍💻 About me
- #️⃣ I’m at my best in C# but I also know TypeScript and Python.
- 💻 Currently building web applications with ASP.NET
- 👨🏽‍💻 Looking for full time work!

> I have been helping people create a digital presence online since 2016. Recently I have returned to school to supplement my skills in design with an education in web application programming and database design. I have done game development as a hobby for many years and I hope to explore the educational potential of game development tools in the future. I'm interested in all things data which is why I love web applications!

<h2 align="center">Thanks for stopping by 👋</h2>
